**IMPORTANT UPDATE AS OF 2019-11-26**: The `jpm` package and its libraries are no longer maintained as Firefox no longer supports add-ons built with `jpm`. If you're building a new add-on, consider a
[WebExtension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions)
instead and check out the [web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext)
tool which has all the same features as `jpm`. Here are some
[resources](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/developer/communication#Migration_paths_for_developers_of_legacy_add-ons)
to help you migrate a legacy `jpm` built add-on.

jetpack-id [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla-jetpack/jetpack-id.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla-jetpack/jetpack-id)
======

Takes a [Jetpack](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Jetpack) addon manifest object and returns a properly formatted ID for the addon. Works with [cfx](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/cfx) and [jpm](http://github.com/mozilla/jpm) and any Jetpack addon that uses a `package.json`.

## Usage

```javascript
var getID = require("jetpack-id");

getID({ name: "my-addon" }); // "@my-addon"
getID({ id: "tab-fixer@addon" }); // "tab-fixer@addon"

// Manifest's generated by cfx generate an ID that is invalid -- this
// should be manually changed to be compatable with AMO by appending
// a `@jetpack` at the end, and this module does NOT do that.
getID({ id: "jid1-JtUwP0fsy08AKw" }); // null
```

## Installing

* `npm install jetpack-id`
